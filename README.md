# NEXT-HiKES-PROJECT


The investor is interested in purchasing TellCo, an existing mobile service provider in the Republic of Pefkakia.  TellCoâ€™s current owners have been willing to share their financial information but have never employed anyone to look at their system-generated data.

Your employer wants you to provide a report to analyze opportunities for growth and make a recommendation on whether TellCo is worth buying or selling.  You will do this by analyzing a telecommunication dataset that contains useful information about the customers & their activities on the network. You will deliver insights you managed to extract to your employer through an easy-to-use web-based dashboard and a written report
